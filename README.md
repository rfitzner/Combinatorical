# Combinatorical
A program that simulated some models from the field of combinatorics and statistical physics. 

While doing my PhD (2008-2013), I was suprised about the lack of visualisations of the models that we analyse in statistical physicals. For this reason I create an program to generation realizations of the models that I encounter. The program started quite simple, but grew other time in include a large number of models. The interface is quite simple, as my focus was the ability to create (sequences of) images to visualise the process. I invite everyone to use this program to generate pictures and animations to be used within teaching/research. Next to the source code I prove the compiled version .jar and an executable that has been compiled for windows.

Feel free to use this code an develope it further.
